### 📚 Research Highlights 📚

**At-the-Market (ATM) Offerings**  
I study the role of at-the-market (ATM) offerings as a distinct corporate financing strategy. Leveraging a novel data collection method using the OpenAI API, I systematically extract ATM issuance data from public filings.  
My findings show that firms primarily use ATMs to address immediate liquidity needs, treating them as flexible substitutes for cash reserves. Compared to seasoned equity offerings (SEOs), ATMs generate more muted market reactions, offering firms an efficient, low-impact financing option.

**Stablecoins, Fintechs, and Macroeconomic Equilibrium**  
I investigate how the emergence of stablecoins and stablecoin-issuing fintechs reshape macroeconomic equilibrium dynamics. Using a Lagos-Wright (New Monetarist) framework, I model the interactions between traditional financial institutions and decentralized digital money issuers, examining implications for liquidity provision, monetary policy effectiveness, and financial stability.
